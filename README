Perl-Porters & Gentlefolk!


May I direct your attention to a well tested implementation of
b-trees.  It is my humble hope that the package may be of assistance
in re-designing perl's built-in collection types and fixing their tie
interfaces.

The reasons for another btree implementation are as follows:

- Publically available code is the best tested.  Buggy b-trees are
completely unacceptable.  This module includes test coverage analysis.

- The algorithms have been completely separated from any notion of a
database; the code is tweaked for easy embedding into other
applications.

Enjoy!
